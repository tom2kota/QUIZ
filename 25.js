/*
Why is it usually better to work with Object instead of Arrays to store a collection of records?

? working with objects makes the code more readable

objects are more efficient in terms of storage

most operations involve looking up a record, and objects can do that better than arrays

adding a record to an object is significantly faster than pushing a record into an array
