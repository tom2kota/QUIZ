JavaScript Conditional Statements
http://www.cev.washington.edu/lc/CLWEBCLB/jst/js_conditionals.html

In JavaScript we have three conditional statements:

    if statement - use this statement if you want to execute a set of code when a condition is true
    if...else statement - use this statement if you want to select one of two sets of lines to execute
    switch statement - use this statement if you want to select one of many sets of lines to execute
